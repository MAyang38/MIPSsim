# MIPSsim
The disassemble and simulator of MIPS architecture binary code.


ecnu architecture course

In this project you will create a simple MIPS simulator which will perform the following two tasks:
•   The first component of your implementation should be capable of loading a specified MIPS text file1 and generating the assembly code equivalent to the input file (disassembler).
•   The second component should generate the instruction-by-instruction simulation of the MIPS code (simulator). It should also produce/print the contents of registers and data memories after execution of each instruction.
